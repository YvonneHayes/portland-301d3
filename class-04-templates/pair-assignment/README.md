# Templates

Fix up the blog codebase, so it's properly using Handlebars templates.

You should be familiar with the pair flow by now. If not, review previous instructions.

## TODOs: MVP
1. Include the Handlebars.js file in your project.
1. Convert your existing template html code into a Handlebars style template.
1. Update your article `.toHTML` method to use Handlebars
1. You may find it useful to attach some additional properties to your article object, before you hand it off to the template.

# TODOs: Stretch Goals
1. Look at all that duplicated markup in your `#filter` list items! Looks like a good opportunity to use a template. Make a small template for filters, and re-render the list once you have data to populate it with.

Find those `TODO` items in the codebase, and tackle each one of them.

1. Driver: Ensure you copy the starter code folder to a new folder named for your pair!
1. Now cd into that new folder. This is where you will write code.
1. Type `atom .` to open the new folder as a project in Atom.
1. Use the Atom "Find in Project" feature to locate all the TODO items.
1. Work through one or two TODO items, testing your code as you go, until you are happy with how it's working.
1. In your terminal type `git status` to view the files that you have changed. You should only see the files that you have worked on.
1. Type `git add file1 file2` where file1, file2, etc. are the files that you have changed.
1. Type `git status` to view the files that have been added to your commit. You should only see the files that you worked on.
1. Type `git diff --staged` to view the differences between the previous version and the staged version of your file.
1. Type `git commit -m "Some meaningful message"` where Some meaningful message is a message that explains your commit.
1. Type `git status` to make sure there is nothing to commit.
1. Type `git push origin class-04` to push the class-04 branch changes to your forked repo on GitHub.

## Switch roles
1. Navigator: You can now clone the driver's fork, to your own local dev environment. As a collaborator, you can `pull` and `push` changes.
1. Handoff: The navigator now becomes the driver. The new driver now opens the code in Atom (see above), and has hands on the keyboard to work through the next one or two TODO items.

## Submit your assignment

When you are finished with your work (or if time runs out), then submit your work. To do this, you'll create a PR to the upstream repo with your changes, note the duration of the assignment and who you worked with, and submit that PR link in Canvas.

See previous instructions, if you'd like to review the steps.
